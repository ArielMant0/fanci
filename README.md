## FANCI: Feature-based Automated NXDomain Classification Intelligence
FANCI is a prototype implementation of a machine learning based classification engine for non-existent domains to detect domain gernation algorithm malware traffic.

## Installation and Usage Hints
FANCI was tested and used on Ubuntu 16.04 and MacOS using Anaconda Python Environments. To get started its a good idea to use a Python Interpreter such as IPython and play around a little bit.

## Research Paper
FANCI is the result of research. You can find the corresponding research paper here: [FANCI - Usenix 2018](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/schuppen)
